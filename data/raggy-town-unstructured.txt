In the lively town of RaggyTown, each street tells a story about the people who live there.

RaggyTown has its share of shops that bring everyone together. The Grocery Guild is open every day, while Hardware Haven takes Sunday off. The Pet Place welcomes visitors from Tuesday through Sunday, and the Silver Screen Cinema lights up only on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. For everyday errands, Car Wash Corner and Coffeehouse Commons never close their doors, running all week long.

So it goes in RaggyTown: colorful streets, neighbors with quirks, beloved pets with legs that don’t always match expectations, and shops that keep the little town buzzing.
